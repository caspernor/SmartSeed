      <h2>Our Farming Techniques</h2>
      <p>Our vertical farm uses a state-of-the-art hydroponic system that allows us to grow plants in a controlled
        environment without soil. This system conserves water by recycling it through the roots of the plants and
        eliminates the need for harmful pesticides and herbicides. Our plants receive the perfect amount of nutrients
        and light to grow quickly and produce high-quality, flavorful produce year-round.</p>
